current mf.w has manual changes, which revert mf-web2w.patch
TODO: change pascal-mf.patch and maybe web-mf.patch that the
      same mf.w will be obtained automatically without using
      mf-web2w.patch and manual changes, and then remove
      web2w/mf.w from git control
TODO: compare `cp mf.w web2w; git diff web2w/mf.w' with ctex.patch and add missing changes concerning cweave (limbo, doc-parts, index)
