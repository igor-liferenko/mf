current mf.w has manual changes, which revert mf-web2w.patch
TODO: change pascal-mf.patch and maybe web-mf.patch that the
      same mf.w will be obtained automatically without using
      mf-web2w.patch and manual changes, and then remove
      web2w/mf.w from git control, run
      diff -u web2w/mf.w mf.w >web2w/cmf.patch
      and uncomment applying cmf.patch in web2w/Makefile,
      and then you may start adding UTF-8 support to mf.w and changing printf to wprintf in exit.ch
