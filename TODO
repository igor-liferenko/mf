find out why "make view" does not show wl.w in full (and if making the first section starred does not influence it, remove @* from wl.w because it is unnecessary there?)

Use an MWE:
cweave -x a
cweave -x b
create ab.tex like mf-wl.tex
tex ab
NO, better do this:
start with tcb.tex in cwebtest/ and remove content from \input files little
by little until failure occurs
