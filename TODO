when all LH-fonts will compile, replace symlinks with real files and change tabs to spaces and rm tab.ch

web2w/mf.w has manual changes, which revert mf-web2w.patch - to see them do:
  make -C web2w
  git diff web2w/mf.w
TODO: remove mf-web2w.patch and change pascal-mf.patch and maybe web-mf.patch that the
diff will be empty, and then do:
  diff -u web2w/mf.w mf.w >web2w/cmf.patch
  git add web2w/cmf.patch
  git rm web2w/mf.w mf.w
and then patch web2w/mf.w with cmf.patch in the end of web2w/Makefile
and then in Makefile do:
  patch -so mf.w web2w/mf.w goto.patch
