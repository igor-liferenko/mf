Based on https://w3-o.cs.hm.edu/users/ruckert/public_html/web2w/

Add this `mf' script to PATH:

    #!/bin/sh
    export edit=/tmp/edit.$$
    export screen_size=WIDTHxHEIGHT
    /path/to/mf/plain "$@"
    ret=$?
    /path/to/tex/newline
    [ -e $edit ] && sed 's/.* /You want to edit file &at line /' $edit
    rm -f $edit
    exit $ret

Adjust path.ch and search.ch

Use either hello-wayland or http://github.com/igor-liferenko/mf-wayland
(set path to hello-wayland in screen.ch)

To view online display you must click on it. After mf exits, online
display, created by it, becomes orphaned, but it remains available.
Before creating online display, mf destroys orphaned online displays.
