Based on https://w3-o.cs.hm.edu/users/ruckert/public_html/web2w/

Add this `mf' script to PATH:

    #!/bin/sh
    export SCREEN_SIZE=...
    /path/to/mf/plain "$@"
    ret=$?
    [ $ret != 134 ] && echo
    exit $ret

Use the companion repo http://github.com/igor-liferenko/mf-wayland
and set path to it in screen.ch

To use debugger, add "-g -Og" and run "gdb plain"

Adjust base_default_length, base_area_length and paths in path.ch
Adjust path to TeXfonts/ in Makefile
Change search.ch as needed

Change-files are for Linux
