@ Allow {\logo METAFONT} to proceed.
This must be done when signal handler is installed {\it and\/} when wayland is fully initialized,
because |SIGINT| may be received in the middle of
wayland initializaiton, which will cause segfault error in libwayland-client.so in \.{dmesg}
output.

This must also be done before exiting in case of error to avoid {\logo METAFONT} being blocked
forever.

The behavior is as follows: if parent did not do |read| before this |write| happens,
this |write| does not block, instead it continues operation as if the data was read.
The parent, if it performs |read| later, will get the passed data in its integrity.
The reason is that the data is buffered, ready to be read when necessary
(see \.{pipe(7)} for more info).

The server has control of a number of objects. In Wayland, these are quite
high-level, such as a DRM manager, a compositor, a text input manager and so on.
These objects are accessible through a {\sl registry}.

We begin the application by connecting to the display server and requesting a
collection of global objects from the server, filling in proxy variables representing them.

@ A main design philosophy of wayland is efficiency when dealing with graphics. Wayland
accomplishes that by sharing memory areas between the client applications and the display
server, so that no copies are involved. The essential element that is shared between client
and server is called a shared memory pool, which is simply a memory area mmapped in both
client and servers. Inside a memory pool, a set of images can be appended as buffer objects
and all will be shared both by client and server.

In this program we |mmap| our hardcoded image file. In a typical application, however, an
empty memory pool would be created, for example, by creating a shared memory object with
|shm_open|, then gradually filled with dynamically constructed image buffers representing
the widgets. While writing this program, the author had to decide if he would create an
empty memory pool and allocate buffers inside it, which is more usual and simpler to
understand, or if he would use a less intuitive example of creating a pre built memory
pool. He decided to go with the less intuitive example for an important reason: if you
read the whole program, you'll notice that there's no memory copy operation anywhere. The
image file is open once, and |mmap|ped once. No extra copy is required. This was done to
make clear that a wayland application can have maximal efficiency if carefully implemented.

@ The buffer object has the contents of a surface. Buffers are created inside of a
memory pool (they are memory pool slices), so that they are shared by the client and
the server. In our example, we do not create an empty buffer, instead we rely on the
fact that the memory pool was previously filled with data and just pass the image
dimensions as a parameter.

@ Objects representing visible elements are called surfaces. Surfaces are rectangular
areas, having position and size. Surface contents are filled by using buffer objects.
During the lifetime of a surface, a couple of buffers will be attached as the surface
contents and the server will be requested to redraw the surfaces. In this program, the
surface object is of type |wl_shell_surface|, which is used for creating top level windows.

@<Create surface@>=
surface = wl_compositor_create_surface(compositor);
if (surface == NULL) {
        @<Notify parent@>;
	exit(1);
}
shell_surface = wl_shell_get_shell_surface(shell, surface);
if (shell_surface == NULL) {
        @<Notify parent@>;
	exit(1);
}
wl_shell_surface_set_fullscreen(shell_surface,
  @=WL_SHELL_SURFACE_FULLSCREEN_METHOD_DEFAULT@>,0,NULL);
wl_shell_surface_add_listener(shell_surface,
  &shell_surface_listener, NULL); /* see |@<Keep-alive@>| for explanation of this */

@ To make the buffer visible we need to bind buffer data to a surface, that is, we
set the surface contents to the buffer data. The bind operation also commits the
surface to the server. In wayland there's an idea of surface ownership: either the client
owns the surface, so that it can be drawn (and the server keeps an old copy of it), or
the server owns the surface, when the client can't change it because the server is
drawing it on the screen. For transfering the ownership to the server, there's the
commit request and for sending the ownership back to the client, the server sends a
release event. In a generic application, the surface will be moved back and forth, but
in this program it's enough to commit only once, as part of the bind operation.

In the Wayland shared memory model, an area of shared memory is created using the
file descriptor for a file. This memory is then mapped into a Wayland structure
called a pool, which represents a block of data of some kind, linked to the
global Wayland shared memory object. This is then used to create a
Wayland buffer, which is used for most of the window operations later.

@<Create buffer@>=
pool = wl_shm_create_pool(shm, STDIN_FILENO, WIDTH*HEIGHT*sizeof(pixel_t));
buffer = wl_shm_pool_create_buffer(pool,
  0, WIDTH, HEIGHT,
  WIDTH*sizeof(pixel_t), WL_SHM_FORMAT_XRGB8888);
wl_shm_pool_destroy(pool);
